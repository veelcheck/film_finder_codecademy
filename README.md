# Film Finder, a Codecademy project  
 
This is a project using API. It shows a random movie withing a chosen genre form the TMDB.  
To run the site, you need to have an API key. [For further instructions click here.](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started)  

Many helper functions were handed to me on a plate in this one, I was also guided how to create getGenres(), getMovies() and getMovieInfo().
NEVERTHELESS, I have learnt a lot, which is what it is all about :)

My input: 
~~- API key aquired from the user by prompt(),~~
- createMovieRuntime() - renders HTML for runtime,
- createMovieReleaseDate() - renders HTML for release date,
- getMovieCast() - gets info about random movie cast,
- createCastList() - renders HTML for getMovieCast(),
- alternated getMovies() - the original one selected a random movie only from the 1st page - I made it choose random page form 1 to 500,
- like and dislike count displayed + reset() for a reset count button (localStorage),
- titles of liked and disliked movies displayed as an ordered list(localStorage),
- all the little alternations needed for the code to work,
- responsive layout.
